# Drum Kit

A simple web app using vanilla JavaScript that lets users play the drum using their keyboard. 
Built as part of Wes Bos’s JavaScript30 challenge to practice DOM manipulation and event handling.

## Features

Press a key to play it's corresponding drum sound.
Keys highlight and make a sound when pressed.
Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Demo

Play a little - https://cactusballs.github.io/DrumKit/

## How It Works

Key Press Detection - using keydown event listeners.
Sound Playback - plays audio files associated with each key (from Wes Bos's files).
CSS Animations-  a visual effect when keys are pressed and an ombre text effect to the title.
